# LDM
LInux Download Manager

ldm0.1 : It is the basic version of the Linux Download Manager. By executing this file it only asks the URL, and it'll get the file name on the basis of the URL. Some time the file name is same as the URL.

ldm0.2 : It is similer to the ldm0.1, but the difference is it ask the name of the file when you execute the file then it asks the URL form the user. It saves the file with the given file name by the user. The file name is also little bit different then the given name, because it replaces all the white spaces to the underscore( _ ) sign.
